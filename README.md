# Database management tool
A simple database management tool in C#.
It was a project for the class named "Advanced database topics".
We'd have to use it in class and perform some tasks given to us.
So i created this app. Not at it's finished state but it did it's job fine.
All you need to do to run this app is 
1. clone it
2. run the .sln with Visual Studio
The ones i use are VS Communitu 2019 and 2022 both seem to work fine with this old project.

Have fun.
